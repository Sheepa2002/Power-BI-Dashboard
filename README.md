Process of Dashboard

Data Collection & Transformation:
Started with raw data, followed by data transformation and cleaning to ensure accuracy. Using custom columns, I derived the most relevant data for insightful analysis.

Power Query Magic:
Once cleaned, the data was uploaded into Power BI, where I leveraged Power Query to streamline further transformations.

Dashboard Design & Visualization:
Designing the dashboard was the fun part! I built a custom background and incorporated interactive slicers, cards, and a range of visuals including Pie charts, Donut charts, Stacked column charts, Bar charts, and Maps—making data exploration effortless and intuitive.

Final Touches & Formatting:
Careful attention was given to formatting and styling to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. A comprehensive and dynamic dashboard that helps visualize trends and patterns in Amazon’s sales data.
